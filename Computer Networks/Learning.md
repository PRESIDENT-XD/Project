## Computer Networks
# Network
- A network is a group of devices that are interconnected to share files and resources. Or it also refers to interconnected array of IoT devices for the sake of communication.
- Example: Laptops, servers, and IoT devices (Cameras, Thermostats, alarms, and Doorlocks) etc.

# Types of Networks
1. Personal Area Networks (PANs)
2. Local Area Networks (LANs)
3. Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs)
4. Wide Area Networks (WANs)
5. Wireless LANs (WLANs)
6. Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

# Personal Area Networks
- A PAN is enables communicatation between devices around a Person. It can be Wireless and Wired.
- Examples: Printer(wired or wireless), Smart-watch (Wireless), Bluetooth, USB etc.
- Note: This network is limited to few centimeters to few meters.

# Local Area Networks
- A LAN is a group of devices, computers and peripheral devices that are connected with eachother, that share connection to server.
- They are limited to small and localized area, like building or site etc.
- They are used to share printer and storage devices.
- They require cable, switches, and routers so that user can connect to internal server, websites and other LANs.

# Metropolitan Area Networks
- A MAN is group of devices that extents to a city, campus or small region. Sometimes it is called/known as Campus Area Network (CAN). 
- A MAN is optimized and larger network than LAN, ranging from a buidling to city or campus.
- Examples: Cable TV networks, telephone networks providing high speed DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) lines or any publiced free wifi for city residents etc.

# Wide Area Network
- A WAN is a network that extends over a large geographical area. WANs are often established with leased telecommunication circuits.
- They are often used by Businesses, Schools, and government entities.
- They are used to relay data from almost anywhere in the world, allowing them to carry out daily functions regardless of location.
- Examples: Internet

# Wireless Local Area Networks
- A WLAN links two or more devices using wireless communication.
- They are limited to small and localized area, such as home, school, campus, office building and computer labs.
- It can provide connection to the wider Internet through gateway device.
- They require cable, switches, and routers so that user can connect to internal server, websites and other LANs.
- Usage Examples: Smartphones, tablets, laptops and gaming consoles.

# Virtual Private Network (VPN)
- Virtual Private Networks are software-based. They control and direct communication across existing physical networks.
- Any physical network location can be assigned to a virtual network by a network administrators.
- They are used to make network administration easier, increase network efficiency, and also improve security.
- They establishes a private or protected network connection across public networks.
- It encrypts internet traffic, disguise online identity, and safeguard data by preventing unathorized people from spy.
